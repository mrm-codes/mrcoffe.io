Introduction

My name is Mario Matundulo, an aspiring software engineer, currently studying at Ed2go academy.

As part of my program, I build a business website, a cafe, as a representation of a local business owner who wants its business to reach more customers and be user-friendly for actual and future customers. This project is to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and GitHub when working with a project. I believe there's a lot to be done, but this is what I could do with the knowledge that I have.

Project Description
This project encompasses a local business being incorporated into a website that allows users to navigate to menus, business events and it has more information about the business. Through the website, users can not only have access to what the business offers, but they also are able to make reservations. 

How to Use it?
1. You can access the website with this link: https://mrm-codes.github.io/mrcoffe.io/
2. Use your mouse or fingertips to navigate through the page.
3. In the home page you can find a navigation menu on the top that can take you to the service that interests you. On the bottom you'll find the same links, in case you need them.
4. The navigation menu contains the business logo, home, menu, events, business information (about) and button to make a reservation. Each item on the navigation menu has your actions. For example, the Logo and home, takes you to the initial page wherever you are. The menu, events and about, takes you to its respective pages. The "make a reservation button" provides you with a form with details of your reservation, such as your name, contact, day and time, and extra notes if you have one.
5. The content varies according to its page. For example, for the menu page, you'll see all the services that businesses offer. On the events page, you'll find past and upcoming events of the business. In the about page, you'll find information about the business, such as story, mission, vision etc.
6. On the bottom, as mentioned earlier, you'll find links to take you back home, menu, event or about the page. You'll also find a message button, in case you want to get in touch with us, recommend, suggest or even complain. You can let us know what you think about the business.

Technologies

2. A computer, with Visual Studio Code installed
3. Programming language like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build the website
4. Other resources were tutorial videos, and W3school.com tutorial lessons.

Ideas for future improvement 
For the future, with new skills, we want to:
1. Offer a order online option with pick up or delivery
2. Create a customizable menu, where customer can decide the amount of ingredients they want in their orders
3. Add more items on business menu
4. Create a way to entertain a customer while they surf on our website or app.
